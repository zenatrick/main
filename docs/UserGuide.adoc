== *Introduction*

Welcome to the User Guide of *Easy Travel (E.T.)*!

Do you enjoy going on overseas trips, but dislike or have trouble planning for it? Fret not, our application, **E.T.**, will help reduce the amount of stress and anxiety when planning for a trip. **E.T.** is a desktop application that helps travellers **manage and plan for their trips**. This application uses a __Command Line Interface (CLI)__; this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can manage your trips faster than other __Graphical User Interface (GUI)__ applications; __GUI__ applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

The purpose of this user guide is to provide you with in-depth documentation on how to install and use our application. What are you waiting for? Head on to <<Quick-Start>>.

[[Quick-Start]]
== *Quick Start*

To get started with using **E.T.**, you can follow these steps:

. Ensure that you have _Java 11_ or above installed in your Computer. If you don’t you can install it using the link to _Oracle_ https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[here]
. Download the latest version of **E.T.** found https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-3/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **E.T.**.
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI shown in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++ should appear in a few seconds.
. You are now on the main page of **E.T.**.
. At the bottom of the screen, type your command in the Command Box (See <<Terminology-GUI>>) and press `Enter` on your keyboard to execute it. E.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will open the help tab.

Refer to <<Command-Syntax>> on how to use commands and +++<u>Section 4 - Features</u>+++ on the commands you can use for each feature.

// tag::faq[]
== *FAQ*

*Q*: How many trips am I able to set in *E.T.*?

*A*: You can only set 1 trip in *E.T.*.

*Q*: Why aren't I allowed to edit my date for the trip?

*A*: Editing the date would cause conflicts in your schedule if you try to change the date to one that is earlier. However, we are working on a feature that will allow you to resolve these conflicts in the upcoming version of *E.T.*.

*Q*: What do I do if I want to change my trip's date since I cannot edit the date?

*A*: Unfortunately, you have to delete the trip.

*Q*: What happens if 2 of my activities are scheduled on the same date and time? Will **E.T.** detect it?

*A*: *E.T.* will allow you to schedule activities that overlap in timing. However, when you check your progress using the `status` command, *E.T.* will notify you of this conflict in timing and the day index that you can find it.

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

*A*: By default, *E.T.* saves all your data in a folder named `data` in the same directory as the application. You can copy and transfer the `data` folder into the same directory as *E.T.* on your other computer and *E.T.* will automatically load your data upon launching *E.T.*.

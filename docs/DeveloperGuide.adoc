== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

In this section, you will learn about the general design and structure of **E.T.**. Subsequently, this section will also describe and explain how each component in **E.T.** works individually. **E.T.** is coded using the <<oop, __Object-Oriented Programming__>> paradigm and it follows the <<facade-pattern, __Facade Pattern__>> and <<command-pattern, __Command Pattern__>> in software design.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The _Architecture Diagram_ below explains the high-level design of the **E.T.**.

.Architecture Diagram of **E.T.**

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The following table gives a quick overview of each component of **E.T.**. More details about the components can be found in the following subsections.

|===
|Component |Description

|`Main`
a|Has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].

It is responsible for:

* At App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with one another.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and cleanup resources where necessary.


|`Commons`
|Represents a collection of classes used by multiple different components.

It contains the LogCenter component. The LogCenter component plays an important role at the architectural level and is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.


|`Ui`
|The UI of the App.

Defines its API in the `Ui` interface and exposes its functionality through the `UiManager` class.


|`Logic`
|Column 2, row 4

|`Model`
|Holds the data of the App in-memory.

Defines its API in the `Model` interface and exposes its functionality through the `ModelManager` class.

|`Storage`
|Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Defines its API in the `Storage` interface and exposes its functionality through the `StorageManager` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the different components interact with one another for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteitem 1`.

.Interactions between components for the `deleteitem 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following subsections will outline the major components in detail.

[#ui-component]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the `Ui` component.

==== Structure

.Structure of the `Ui` component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]
*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `Ui` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of smaller parts such as `ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox` as shown in the __Class Diagram__ above. All UI parts in the `Ui` component including `MainWindow` inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `TabPanel` is an abstract class that represents a tab in the <<gui, __GUI__>> and each tab will display information on different features of **E.T.**. The following classes inherit from the `TabPanel` abstract class:

* `ScheduleTabPanel`
* `ActivityTabPanel`
* `AccommodationBookingTabPanel`
* `TransportBookingTabPanel`
* `PackingListTabPanel`
* `FixedExpenseTabPanel`
* `HelpTabPanel`

Each tab may also contain smaller parts known as cards. A card is a UI component that contains information that is shown to the user. E.g. An `ActivityCard` will contain information about a particular activity.

NOTE: A generic tab is referred to as an `XYZTabPanel` while a generic card is referred to as an `XYZCard`.

The `MainWindow` also has access to 2 more windows, namely:

* `ListPresetWindow`
* `StatusWindow`

NOTE: `XYZWindow` is used to refer to the 2 windows listed above.

The `Ui` component uses <<javafx, __JavaFX__>> UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

==== Responsibilities

The `Ui` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the <<gui, __GUI__>> can be updated with the modified data.

[#logic-component]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the `Ui` component.

==== Structure

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the `Logic` component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]
*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

From the diagram above, you can see that the `Logic` component is split into 2 groups, one for command and another for command parsing. As **E.T.** follows a __Command Pattern__, a specific `XYZCommand` class will inherit from the abstract `Command` class. This allows the `LogicManager` to execute these commands without having to know each command type.

==== Responsibilities

The `Logic` component is in charge of command parsing from the commands given by the user through the `Ui` component. It is also responsible for command execution.

. Logic uses the `EasyTravelParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an activity).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

The steps described above will be the standard command parsing and execution of every command in **E.T.**. To illustrate these steps, the __Sequence Diagram__ for interactions within the `Logic` component when the command `deleteitem 1` is shown below. The diagram starts with the `execute("deleteitem 1")` API call.

.Interactions inside the `Logic` component for the `deleteitem 1` command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifelines for the `DeleteItemCommandParser` and `DeleteItemCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

[#model-component]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the `Model` component.

==== Structure

.Simplified structure of the `Model` component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `UserPrefs` class represents the user’s preference.

The `XYZManager` is a generic name given to the following managers which represent the manager for each feature of **E.T.**:

* `TripManager`
* `ActivityManager`
* `AccommodationBookingManager`
* `TransportBookingManager`
* `PackingListManager`
* `FixedExpenseManager`

The `ObservableList` abstract class is exposed by the `Model` component for the `Ui` component to observe and automatically update the <<gui, __GUI__>> when data in the `Model` component changes. This follows the __Observer Pattern__ in software design.

==== Responsibilities

The `Model` component,

* Represents data of different features of **E.T.**.
* Stores these data in-memory when the App is running.
* Does not depend on the `Ui`, `Logic` and `Storage` components.
* Contains observable data so that the <<gui, __GUI__>> can automatically update upon data changes.

[#storage-component]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

This segment will explain the structure and responsibilities of the `Storage` component.

==== Structure

.Simplified structure of the `Storage` component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `UserPrefsStorage` interface and `XYZStorage` interface define the API for reading and saving the `Model` component’s data from and to the hard disk.

The `JsonXYZStorage` is the implementation of the `XYZStorage` interface which manages the storage for various features. The following __Class Diagram__ will describe the structure of a `JsonFixedExpenseStorage` as an example. The other storage class will follow a similar structure.

.Structure of the `FixedExpenseStorage`
image::FixedExpenseStorageClassDiagram.png[]

==== Responsibilities

The `Storage` component,

* Can save the `UserPref` object in a <<json, __JSON__>> format.
* Can parse a `json` file in the correct format to get the `UserPref` object.
* Can save the `XYZManager` data in a <<json, __JSON__>> format.
* Can parse a `json` file in the correct format to get the `XYZManager`’s data.

[#commons-component]
[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

The `Common` component contains classes used by multiple other components in the `team.easytravel.commons` package.

[#implementation]

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::tripmanagement[]

=== Trip Manager
*E.T*  allows the user to plan for an overseas trip. *E.T* is implemented in a way that the user can only plan for one single trip at any time. i.e. Only a single trip’s data can be managed. In this Trip Manager feature, the user can set, edit and delete his/her trip details. The trip details includes:


* `title`
* `budget`
* `exchangeRate`
* `startDate`
* `endDate`


==== Rationale
The Trip Manager feature is included in **E.T.** because it is the core feature of the application. If the user wants to plan for an overseas trip, he/she has to record details about the trip.

==== Current Implementation
The `TripManager` class in the `Model` component is responsible for all operations on the trip which is represented by the `Trip` class. The following _Class Diagram_ describes the structure of the `TripManager` and its relevant classes.


.Structure of the `TripManager` and its relevant classes
image::developer-guide/trip/TripClassDiagram.png[]

As seen from the diagram, the `TripManager` can only manage one trip at any point in time.
Next, the following table shows the commands related to managing the trip details.


|===
|Command |Purpose

|`settrip`
|Adds a trip and sets the trip details.

|`rename`
|Edits the trip title.

|`editbudget`
|Edits the budget of the trip.

|`deletetrip`
|Deletes the trip and all the data in the App.
|===

This ability to change the start and end dates and the exchange rate of the trip is not available.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Number of trips allowed to be managed


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Only one
|Easy to implement. `TripManager` just needs to hold one `Trip` object.
|Less flexibility for the user.

|**Option 2** +
More than one
|More flexibility for the user.
|More overhead, especially in terms of space.
|===

Reasons for choosing the option 1:

* A typical user would only plan one trip at a time. Thus, the overhead incurred by option 2 is not justified.
* Limited time for implementing this feature. Thus, option 1 is more ideal.


===== Aspect: Ability to edit the details of the trip

|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Can only edit the title and budget.
|Easy to implement. Nothing depends on the trip title and budget.
|Users who need to change the dates or exchange rate of the trip need to delete and then set the trip which is troublesome.

|**Option 2** +
Can edit every detail.
|More flexibility and convenience for the user.
|The schedule feature depends on the trip dates while the expense feature depends on the exchange rate. Thus, allowing these fields to be changed is very difficult to implement and likely to result in bugs.
|===

Reasons for choosing option 1:

* The exchange rate of a trip does not tend to fluctuate much, thus the cons of option 2 outweigh the pros for the exchange rate.
* As for the trip dates, the schedule feature is a big feature of **E.T.** and it depends on the trip dates. Given the limited time for implementation, we decided to opt for a less bug-prone approach that can showcase **E.T.**’s feature.

// end::tripmanagement[]

// List management
// tag::listmanagement[]
[#list-manager]
[[List-Manager]]
=== List Managers
**E.T.** allows the user to manage different essential lists for their trip.

These list include: +
* Activities
* Transport Bookings
* Fix Expenses
* Accommodation Bookings
* Packing List

All these lists are managed by `ListManager`s which support basic <<crud, __CRUD__>> operations and some additional operations for users to manage their list efficiently. The term __item__ will be used to refer to the elements stored in a list.

Common commands for all `ListManager`s:

* `add` — Creates a new __item__
* `delete` — Deletes an existing __item__
* `edit` — Edits an existing __item__
* `sort` — Sorts the list by the given specification
* `list` — List all __items__ in the list.

==== Rationale
When planning for a trip, there are many things that the user may want to keep track of. This is our reason for creating the 5 lists stated above. The `ListManager`s are thus created to help the user manage the 5 lists so that they can plan their trip conveniently and efficiently.


==== Current Implementation
In this section, we will first explain the structure of a typical `ListManager` also known as an `XYZListManager`. As mentioned earlier in the overview of this section, the term __item__ will be used to refer to the elements stored in a list.

The `XYZListManager` contains a `UniqueList` which is a data structure that stores all the __items__ of a list. The `UniqueList` makes use of Java’s <<generics, __generics__>> and can only contain __items__ that implement the `UniqueListElement` interface. This is because the uniqueness of an element in the `UniqueList` is determined by the returned value of the `isSame()` method of the UniqueListElement interface.

In addition, the `XYZListManager` implements the `ReadOnlyXYZManager` interface. This interface has the `getXYZList()` method which returns an `ObservableList` of __items__. For example, `ActivityManager` implements `ReadOnlyActivityManager`. The `ObservableList` of __items__ allows the `Ui` model to use the __Observer Pattern__ to update the <<gui, __GUI__>>.

The following __Class Diagram__ describes the aforementioned structure of the `ActivityManager`.


.Structure of `ActivityManager`
image::developer-guide/list-managers/ListManagerClassDiagram.png[]

The following paragraphs will describe what happens when the user performs an operation on a `ListManager` through commands. `XYZCommand` here will refer to a command described above for the 5 `ListManager` s. (e.g. `AddActivityCommand`, `EditTransportBookingCommand`).

As described in <<Design-Logic>>, after the user enters a command, the `EasyTravelParser` will generate an `XYZCommandParser` which parses the user input parameters and generate an executable `XYZCommand` that performs an operation on the list.

We will describe the execution of an `XYZCommand`, using `AddActivityCommand` as an example. All other `XYZCommand` will be executed in similar ways.

When `AddActivityCommand` is executed, an `Activity` will be added to the list of activities managed by the `ActivityManager` in the `Model` component.

The __Sequence Diagram__ below shows the execution of the `AddActivityCommand`:

.Execution of the `AddActivityCommand`
image::developer-guide/list-managers/AddActivitySequenceDiagram.png[Schedule Activity Command Execution]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `AddActivityCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `AddActivityCommand` execution.


====

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Separation between scheduling and activity management


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Use 5 different list managers to manage the 5 main features


|Keeps everything separate which abide by the Separation of Concerns Principle (SoC) principle.

Achieves better modularity by separating the code into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.

Allows for different behaviours of each list manager

|Tedious to implement as we have many lists to manage.

|**Option 2** +
Use a single manager to handle all the 5 lists


|Easy to implement as we only need to write one `ListManager` class.

|Violates SoC.
|===

Reason for choosing option 1:

Applying SoC limits the ripple effect when changes are introduced to a specific part of the system. Since we are constantly changing our system during development, abiding by SoC will save us time in the long-run as less code is affected when changes to the system are made.

===== Aspect: Implementation behind a list manager


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Extract the common operations and functionality of the 5 ``ListManager``s into one `UniqueList` class. All 5 ``ListManager``s will make use of the `UniqueList` as their internal data structure and build their operations on top of it.

|Abide by the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Minimize repeated code as all ``ListManager``s use the basic functionality of `UniqueList`.

|All ``ListManager``s have dependencies on `UniqueList`. Thus, `UniqueList` has to be implemented before starting on any `ListManager`. This slows down the implementation of all ``ListManager``s.

|**Option 2** +
Do not extract any common operations and functionalities


|Each `ListManager` can be worked on by different people as there is no dependency on a common data structure that has to be implemented beforehand. Allows each feature to be worked on separately by different developers.

|Violates the DRY principle as there will be common operations between ``ListManager``s.
|===

Reason for choosing option 1:

* It is a good coding practice to follow the DRY principle.
* The implementations of the ``ListManager``s are done quite early on, where our team has more flexibility in terms of deadline. Thus, we can afford to spend more time developing the `UniqueList` data structure before starting on the implementation of any `ListManager`

// End list management
//end::listmanagement[]

//tag::activitymanager[]
=== Activity Manager
**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their activities for his/her trip. The activity manager is one of the `ListManager` s  (See <<List-Manager>>). On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also allows the user to search for their activities using the `findacitivty` command. The parameters of the `findactivity` command are keywords in the activity entries that the user wants to search for. E.g. `findactivity sightseeing carnival` will search and list all activity entries with `sightseeing` or `carnival` in their detail. Another similar command, `findactivitytag` has the same functionality but only searches for the tags of activity entries.

==== Rationale
The activity manager is an important feature to have because any oversea trip will be packed with activities for the traveller. Thus, we decided to create an activity manager as one of the ``ListManager``s.

==== Current Implementation

The current implementation of the activity manager only allows the user to keep track of a list of activities for their trip. It does not allow the user to indicate the start and end time of an activity. Instead, the ability to indicate a start time for an activity will be in another feature known as the Schedule Feature (See <<Schedule-Feature>>).

In this section, we will outline the `findactivity` command of the activity manager which is summarised by the __Activity Diagram__ below.

.Workflow of a `findactivity` command
image::developer-guide/activity/FindActivityDiagram.png[]

When the user enters the `findactivity` command to search for activities, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in <<Design-Logic>>. During the parsing, a predicate is created. This predicate checks if a given `Activity` contains the user input keywords. The `FindActivityCommand` will then receive this predicate when it is created.

The following steps will describe the execution of the `FindActivityCommand` in detail, assuming that no error is encountered.

. When the `execute()` method of the `FindActivityCommand` is called, the `ModelManager`’s `updateFilteredActivityList()` method is called.
. The `ModelManager` then proceeds to call the `updateFilteredActivityList()` method of the `ActivityManager`.
. The `ActivityManager` will then update its filtered list of `Activity`s to contain only `Activity`s that fulfil the given predicate.
. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the <<gui, __GUI__>>.
. If the above steps are all successful, the `ScheduleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The __Sequence Diagram__ below summarises the aforementioned steps.

.Execution of the `FindActivityCommand`

image::developer-guide/activity/FindActivitySequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `FindActivityCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `FindActivityCommand` execution.

====

==== Design Consideration
We do not have other implementation options for the `FindActivityCommand` as the current implementation is the only option that we came up with. This option is quite easy to understand and follows good coding principles.
// end::activitymanager[]

// tag::scheduleactivity[]
[#schedule-feature]
[[Schedule-Feature]]
=== Schedule Feature
**E.T.** allows the user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time of a day. This is done using the `schedule` command which requires the user to specify the `ACTIVITY_INDEX` of an activity from the displayed activity list, the `DAY_INDEX` of the trip and the `START_TIME` of the activity to be scheduled.

==== Rationale
The schedule feature is an important feature that allows the users to manage and plan for their trip schedule or itinerary. This feature is added to **E.T.** to separate from the activity management feature from the schedule. This can increase the ease of planning because users can just focus on the time management aspect when scheduling proposed activities from the activity list. The schedule feature also automatically adds any transport bookings into the schedule.

==== Current Implementation
The schedule feature uses a separate system and structure as compared to the ``ListManager``s. Instead, the schedule feature will be more closely related to the trip feature because it heavily relies on information about the `Trip` such as the `startDate` and `endDate`.

As such, the `TripManager` is in charge of managing the schedule. The `TripManager`, contains a list of ``DaySchedule``s which represents the schedule of a specific day of the `Trip`. Thus, the number of ``DaySchedule``s equals the number of days in the `Trip`. E.g. a trip of 2 days means that the `TripManager` contains 2 `DaySchedule` objects.

Within each `DaySchedule` object, there is a `UniqueList` of `DayScheduleEntry`. The `DayScheduleEntry` object represents an entry in the schedule.
As an example, the following UML object diagram describes the relevant objects related to this feature when a `Trip` of 2 days is set.


.Example of associations between related objects of the schedule feature
image::developer-guide/schedule/ScheduleFeatureObjectDiagram.png[]

When the user enters the `schedule` command to schedule an activity, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in <<Design-Logic>> . A `ScheduleCommand` will then be created.
The following steps describe the execution of the `ScheduleCommand`, assuming that no error is encountered.

. When `execute()` of the `ScheduleCommand` is called, the `ModelManager` retrieves the displayed list of activities shown to the user.
. Then, it retrieves the target `Activity` using the user-specified `INDEX`.
. The `ModelManager`’s `scheduleActivity()` method is called to schedule the target `Activity`.
. The `ModelManager` proceeds to call the `scheduleActivity()` method of the `TripManager`.
. The `TripManager` then uses the given activity to create a corresponding `DayScheduleEntry` object.
. The `TripManager` will calculate which day of the trip to schedule this activity and get the `DaySchedule` representing the schedule of the target day.
. The target activity is then scheduled on the target day through the `addScheduleEntry()` method of the target `DaySchedule`.
. If the above steps are all successful, the `ScheduleCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The  _Sequence Diagram_ below summarizes the execution of the `ScheduleCommand`.

.Execution of the `ScheduleCommand`
image::developer-guide/schedule/ScheduleCommandExecution.png[Schedule Activity Command Execution]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `ScheduleCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `ScheduleCommand` execution.

[#schedule-design-consideration]
[[Schedule-Design-Consideration]]
==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Separation between scheduling and activity management


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Scheduling is separated from activity management.

|Better user experience.

Allows for extensions as other types of objects such as a `TransportBooking` could easily be converted into a `DayScheduleEntry` object and be added into the schedule. This is by the Open-Closed principle.
|Complicated to implement and more likely to result in bugs if undesirable dependencies are introduced.

|**Option 2** +
An activity must be scheduled directly into a day as it is added.
i.e. `ActivityManager` is in charge of scheduling.

|Straightforward and simple to implement.

|Other types of objects such as `TransportBooking` will not be able to be scheduled. This can result in poorer user experience when using **E.T.** as users may want to include transport bookings into their schedule.
|===

Reasons for choosing option 1:

* The schedule feature is a major feature because it is the main part of planning for a trip. Thus, we decided to opt for the option with better user experience.
* The ability for other objects to be converted into a `DayScheduleEntry` object in option 1 is also beneficial for future versions of **E.T.** if we want to extend this feature to schedule other items such as accommodation bookings.

// end::scheduleactivity[]


// tag::accommodationbooking[]
=== Accommodation Booking Manager

**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their accommodation bookings for his/her trip. The accommodation booking manager is one of the ``ListManager``s (See <<List-Manager>>). On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also prevents the user from having overlapping accommodation bookings.

==== Rationale

The transport booking manager is an important feature to have because any oversea trip of more than one day will require some form of accommodation. Thus, we decided to create an accommodation booking manager as one of the ``ListManager``s.

==== Current Implementation

When a user adds an accommodation booking, the `Logic` Component parses the user input and creates an `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object (See <<Design-Logic>>). When the `execute()` method of `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` is called, the execution will check if the new accommodation booking overlaps with any other other current bookings.

Using a Java’s <<stream, __stream__>>, the new accommodation booking will be checked against all other bookings in the list to look for any overlaps.
We used an interval overlap detection algorithm to check for overlap between 2 accommodation bookings. If the total duration of the 2 accommodation bookings is within the __acceptable duration__ of the algorithm, then there is no overlap.
__acceptable duration__ = latest end day - earliest start day

The following diagram gives a visual explanation on this interval overlap detection algorithm.

.Visual explanation on the interval overlap detection algorithm
image::developer-guide/accommodation-booking/OverlappingIntervalAlgorithm.png[]

The following steps describe the flow of an overlap check between 2 accommodation bookings:

. The start day and end day of both bookings are retrieved using `getStartDay()` and `getEndDay()` methods of the `AccommodationBooking` object.
. The total duration of both accommodation bookings is calculated.
. The latest end day and earliest start day is obtained.
. The __acceptable duration__ is calculated.
. If the __acceptable duration__ is greater than the total duration of both bookings, there is no overlap. The overlap check will continue for the next accommodation booking until the last.
If there is an overlap, the check will stop and the user will receive a message that informs them that the new accommodation booking will overlap with another booking.

The __Activity Diagram__ below summaries the above steps.

.Workflow of an overlap check between 2 accommodation bookings
image::developer-guide/accommodation-booking/FindOverlapActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Calculating overlap of the new accommodation booking with the other accommodation bookings in the list

|===
| |Pros |Cons
|**Option 1 (Current)** +
Use an interval overlap detection algorithm.

In the worst case, the checking for overlap against all accommodation booking takes O(n) time where n is the number of accommodation bookings

|Simple and easy to implement.

Only require constant space to calculate overlaps between 2 intervals.

|Requires some calculation.

|**Option 2** +
Use a hashtable to store the days that have been accounted for.

In the worst case, the checking for overlap against all accommodation booking takes O(d) time where d is the number of days.

|Simple and easy to implement.

Checking for any particular day takes constant time.

|Require a large amount of storage space to save the hashtable data.
|===

Reason for choosing option 1:

* Both options are simple and easy to implement. However, option 2 has a larger overhead due to the hashtable it uses. Thus, we decided option 1 is better.

// end::accommodationbooking[]

// tag::transportbooking[]
=== Transport Booking Manager

**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their transport bookings for his/her trip. The transport booking manager is one of the ``ListManager``s (See <<List-Manager>>). On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also automatically adds all the transport bookings into the trip schedule.

==== Rationale

The transport booking manager is an important feature to have because any oversea trip will require some form of transportation to the destination and back. Thus, we decided to create a transport booking manager as one of the ``ListManager``s.

==== Current Implementation

The transport bookings are managed by the `TransportBookingManager` class. In this section, we will describe how a transport booking is automatically added to the schedule when the user adds a transport booking.

The following __Class Diagram__ describes the structure of the `TransportBookingManager` and how it is related to the `TripManager` which handles the scheduling of activities and transport bookings. Only relevant classes and methods are shown in the diagram.

.Structure of the `TransportBookingManager`
image::developer-guide/transport-booking/TransportBookingFeatureClassDiagram.png[]

From the diagram, it is clear that the `TransportBookingManager` has no direct association with the `TripManager`. The following steps will outline how a transport booking is added to the schedule managed by the `TripManager` when the user tries to add a transport booking to the `TransportBookingManager` using the `addtransport` command.

. The user enters the `addtransport` command to add a transport booking.
. The command is parsed by the `Logic` component and an `AddTransportBookingCommand` is created. (See <<Design-Logic>>)
. During the execution of the `AddTransportBookingCommand`, a `DayScheduleEntry` representing this transport booking is first created. (See <<Schedule-Feature>> for more information on the schedule feature)
. The day to schedule this transport booking is calculated.
. If the calculation returns an out-of-bound day of the current `Trip`, an error message will be shown to the user.
. Else, the `AddTransportBookingCommand` will add the `DayScheduleEntry` to the schedule through the `ModelManager`’s `scheduleTransportBooking()` method.
. Finally, `AddTransportBookingCommand` will then add the transport booking into the `TransportBookingManager`.

The following __Activity Diagram__ summarizes the workflow mentioned above.

.Workflow of how a transport booking is automatically scheduled
image::developer-guide/transport-booking/AddTransportBookingActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration
The design consideration for this feature is similar to that of the Schedule feature. (See <<Schedule-Design-Consideration>>)
This is because if we let the `ActivityManager` manage the schedule and activities, then the schedule can only contain activities. This means that transport bookings will become a basic `ListManager` (See <<List-Manager>>) with no special functionalities. Thus, we decided to adopt the current implementation for better user experience and potential future extensions.
// end::transportbooking[]


// tag::packinglist[]
=== Packing List Manager

**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their packing list for his/her trip. The packing list manager is one of the `ListManager` s (See <<List-Manager>>). On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also allows the user to add built-in lists of items into his/her current packing list through the `addpreset` command.

E.g. the `addpreset swimming` will add items related to swimming into the packing list. The term __preset__ will be used to refer to the built-in list of packing list items.

==== Rationale
The packing list manager is an important feature to have because there are many things that a traveller wants to bring for his/her oversea trip. The packing list will help the user ensure that he/she did not forget to pack anything for the trip. Thus, we decided to create a packing list manager as one of the `ListManager`s.

==== Current Implementation

When a user enters the `addpreset` command, the `Logic` Component parses the user input and creates an `AddPresetCommand` object (See <<Design-Logic>>). When the `execute()` method of `AddPresetCommand` is called, the execution of this command will retrieve the target preset specified by the user into the packing list.

The __Activity Diagram__ below shows how a preset is added to the packing list.


.Workflow of the `addpreset` command
image::developer-guide/packing-list/AddPackingListActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Customizability of the preset


|===
||Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)**: +
Users can only choose the preset from the built-in lists

|Provides the user with more convenience as it allows the user to add an existing built-in list into their packing list instead of adding one item at a time.
|Restricts the freedom of the user due to lack of customizability

|**Option 2:** +
Users create their own presets

|Gives the user a lot of freedom to customise their presets and packing list, making the application user focused.
|Difficult to implement as we would need to introduce more validation rules and checks to ensure the user creates a valid preset.

|**Option 3:** +
Combine both option 1 and 2

|Provides the best user experience as this option gets the benefit of both the previous 2 options.
|Complicated and takes a long time to implement.
|===

Reasons for choosing option 1:

* Due to time restriction, we only have enough time to implement either option 1 or 2 by **E.T. v1.4**.
* We want to focus on giving the user the best first time experience when using **E.T.**. Thus, option 1 is more suitable as it provides convenience for the user when he first use **E.T.**.
* Option 2 is only useful when the user uses **E.T.** for more than one trip and he/she wants to save his previous packing list to add for the next trip.
// end::packinglist[]

// tag::fixedexpense[]
=== Fixed Expense Manager

**E.T.** allows the user to keep track of their fixed expenses for his/her trip. The fixed expense manager is one of the ``ListManager``s (See <<List-Manager>>). On top of the basic operations provided by a `ListManager`, it also allows the user to set a budget for the trip and automatically converts any fixed expenses entered in foreign currency into Singapore Dollars (SGD).

==== Rationale
The fixed expense manager is an important feature to have because many travellers would want to manage their expense for an overseas trip. We also found out that most accommodations are commonly charged in a foreign currency instead of SGD. This prevented travelers from having a clearer picture of how much they have spent on these big ticket items before their trip. Thus, we decided to create a transport booking manager as one of the ``ListManager``s with an automatic conversion feature.

==== Current Implementation

Currently, the information on the trip’s budget and the exchange rate is stored as fields in the `Trip` class which is managed by the `TripManager`. All fixed expenses, on the other hand, is managed by the `FixedExpenseManager`.

The following __Class Diagram__ shows the association between relevant classes of this feature.


.Structure of the `FixedExpenseManager` and its relevant classes.
image::developer-guide/fixed-expense/FixedExpenseClassDiagram.png[]


The Activity Diagram below summarises what happens when the user adds a fixed expense entry using the `addexpense` command.

.Workflow of the `addexpense` command
image::developer-guide/fixed-expense/AddFixedExpenseActivityDiagram.png[]

When a user enters the `addexpense` command, the `Logic` Component parses the user input and creates an `AddExpenseCommand` object. <<Design-Logic>>

The following steps describes the execution of the AddFixedExpenseCommand:

. When `execute()` of the `AddExpenseCommand` is called, the current exchange rate is obtained from `TripManager` through `ModelManager`.
. A new `FixedExpense` object is created. The amount will be converted to SGD if it is in foreign currency.
. The newly created `FixedExpense` object is added to the `FixedExpenseManager` through the `ModelManager`’s `addFixedExpense()` method.
. The total sum of all expenses is obtained by calling the `getTotalExpense()` method.
. The budget of the trip is obtained by calling the `getBudget()` method.
. The remaining budget is calculated.
. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a contains the success message along with the remaining budget is created and returned.

The following sequence diagram describes the execution of the `AddExpenseCommand` when its `execute()` method is called.

.Execution of the `addexpense` command
image::developer-guide/fixed-expense/AddFixedExpenseCommandExecution.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `AddFixedExpenseCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `AddFixedExpenseCommand` execution.

====

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Which class to store the trip’s budget and fixed expense


|===
| |Pros |Cons

|**Option 1 (Current)**: +
Place the budget and exchange rate as fields in the `Trip` class.

|Follows the Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle. The budget for the trip is an attribute of the trip. Thus, only the `Trip` class should contain the budget.
|The `Model` API has to provide the `getBudget()` and `getExchangeRate()` methods which will take more time to implement.

|**Option 2:** +
Place the budget and exchange rate as fields in the `FixedExpenseManager` class

|Faster to implement as calculations for the remaining budget can be done internally in the `FixedExpenseManager`.
Easy to access and manipulate budget and exchange rate data. Especially when calculating the remaining budget.

|Breaks the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as the `FixedExpenseManager` should only have one job of managing fixed expenses and not manage both expenses and budget.
|===

Reasons for choosing option 1:

* Option 1 follows good coding practices and principles (the SoC and SRP) which makes it more ideal.
* The implementation of this feature is done quite early on, where our team has more flexibility in terms of deadline. Thus, we can afford to spend more time on option 1’s implementation.


// end::fixedexpense[]

[#progress-checker]
=== Progress Checker
This feature allows the user to keep track of the progress of his/her planning. It integrates multiple features to show the user what has been done and what needs to be done for his/her trip. The command to check the current progress is `status`. The following aspect of the trip will be shown to the user:

* `Accommodation` - Accommodation coverage
* `Schedule` - Time clash in the schedule
* `PackingList` - Number of items packed or yet to be packed
* `Expense` - Remaining budget


==== Rationale

This feature is added because as a travel planning application, the user would want to know his progress when planning for a trip. Thus, information on what is done and what needs to be done will help the user gauge his planning progress. The user would also want to know if they have forgotten to plan for any aspect of a trip which will be provided by this feature.

==== Current Implementation
The following __Activity Diagram__ summarizes what happens when a user enters the `status` command.


.Workflow of the `status` command
image::developer-guide/progress-checker/CheckStatusActivityDiagram.png[]

When a user enters the `status` command, the `Logic` Component parses and creates a `CheckStatusCommand` object. (See <<Design-Logic>>).

The execution of the `CheckStatusCommand` undergoes the following steps.

. The `ModelManager`’s `getStatus()` will first be called.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getScheduleStatus()` method of the `TripManager`.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getStatus()` method of the `PackingListManager`.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getStatus()` method of the `FixedExpenseManager`.
. The `ModelManager` calls the `getStatus()` method of the `AccommodationBookingManager`.
. After all the required data is obtained, the `ModelManager` will return the data to the `CheckStatusCommand`.
. The `CheckStatusCommand` will then create a new `CommandResult` object using the data obtained and return this `CommandResult` object.

.Execution of the `CheckStatusCommand`
image::developer-guide/progress-checker/CheckStatusCommandExecution.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The lifelines for the `CheckStatusCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X). However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

This sequence diagram does not take into consideration the possible exceptions which might occur during the `CheckStatusCommand` execution.

====

==== Design Consideration

We do not have other implementation options for this feature as the current implementation is the only option that we came up with. It is also a good option because it follows good coding principles such as the Law of Demeter (LoD). In our implementation, each object only calls the methods of other objects that it is directly associated with.

E.g. the `CheckStatusCommand` object only calls the the `ModelManager` object’s `getStatus()` method and the `ModelManager` object only calls the the `PackingListManager` object’s `getStatus()`. The `CheckStatusCommand` object does not know or have access to the `getStatus()` method of the `PackingListManager` object.


// End checkstatus

[#logging]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Effort
Creating *Easy Travel* was fairly difficult and required much effort from all the team members. We communicated a lot as a team. However, it was difficult because of quarantine measures imposed by the government during this period due to the COVID-19 situation. Nonetheless, we persevered through, and thanks to technology, we were still able to communicate through regular online meetings. Through our consistent communication, we were able to come up with our product, *Easy Travel*. In addition, we managed to accumulate *32,000 lines of code* combined. This showcases our hard work and contributed to into producing *Easy Travel*.

=== Major Enhancement
*Easy Travel* has many enhancement from *AB3*. This following points will highlight some of the major enhancement that *Easy Travel* has.

* From just keeping track of contacts in *AB3*, *Easy Travel* is a major upgrade as it is a all-in-one application that allows the user to keep track of different aspects of planning for a trip. These aspects includes activity, transport bookings, packing list, etc.

* Furthermore, *Easy Travel's* has additional features that complements the list management features. Notably, the *status*, *automated tab switching*, *sorting*, and *schedule* features. These features meant that our app varies greatly from what *AB3* has to offer in terms of user experience. We _designed these features primarily with the user’s needs in mind_ to provide the user with a platform that would ease the pain of planning for an overseas trip.

=== Challenges
Throughout the development of *Easy Travel*, we faced many challenges. The following points will describe these challenges what how did we deal with them.

*Challenge 1:* +
The first challenge we faced was the large increase in the number of entities to code and manage.

** While AB3 deals with only one (`Person`) model object, *Easy Travel* deals with multiple (`Trip`, `Activity`, `TransportBooking`, `AccommodationBooking`, `FixedExpense`, `PackingListItem` and `DayScheduleEntry`) model objects. Thus, even though we were able to refactor some aspects of `Person` into `Trip`, we had to create the rest from scratch.
** Moreover, The `Ui` of *AB3* only contains one panel (`ListPanel`). On the other hand, *Easy Travel* has *7 panels* (`ScheduleTabPanel`, `ActivityTabPanel`, `AccommodationTabPanel`, `TransportationTabPanel`, `PackingListTabPanel`, `FixedExpenseTabPanel`, `HelpTabPanel`). This is a big change from *AB3’s*  `UI`. Additionally, `FixedExpenseTabPanel` contains a `PieChart`, which gives the user a better visual of their expenses breakdown.
** Furthermore, we have multiple new windows, the `StatusWindow` and `ListPresetWindow`.
** The copious amount of entities meant that a larger amount of time would be necessary to code and implement these entities.

*How we solve it:* +
To overcome this challenge, our team placed heavy emphasis on team communication and efficient division of workload such that we can complete our part in the shortest time possible. In the end, we were able to overcome this challenge due to good team spirit and member contributions. Our effort can be seen from the *32,000 lines of code* that we have completed in less than two months.


*Challenge 2*: +
Initially, we wanted to allow the user to edit the dates of the trip, once the trip is set. However, if we allowed the user to do so, there will be complications for the *Schedule*, *Accommodation Bookings* and *Transportation Bookings* feature. This is because all three features depend on the start and end date set by the trip. Hence, if we allowed the user to edit the dates of the trip, it could result in complicated code and bugs.

*How we solve it:* +
We decided to prevent the user from editing the start and end dates of the trip. If the user wants to edit the trip dates, he/she has to delete the trip and start again with the new dates which as warned in the User Guide. We felt that this decision was justified because we have limited time to complete our project and we want to work on more meaning features instead of this obscure problem.

=== Conclusion
Overall, we managed to achieve our goal, which was to create an application that can help ease the pain of planning for a trip. We created an all-in-one trip manager, a user interface that is neat and organised, and implemented user-focused features.

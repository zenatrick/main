== PROJECT: EasyTravel
This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to the *E.T. Easy Travel* project.
The Github Link to *E.T. Easy travel* can be found here : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-3/main

== Overview
E.T. is a desktop travel planning application to provide a simple an easy way for users to prepare for their trip. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

Implemented Fixed Expense Tab along with its User Interface and commands (CRUD/Sort)

** What it does: Enable to user to add and subsequently modify their fixed expenses prior to the trip.

** Justification: This feature empowers the user to track their current expenses prior to their trip. By adding and subsequently modifying their expenses, the user would know how much of their
budget they have spent thus far, resolving the problem that our users, tend to overspend during their trip. Also, users are provided with an avenue to view their fixed expenses in a readable and organised manner.

** Highlights: (Change later) This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{Address Book 3 and Jeffry Lum for his guidance, time and support. }_

* *Minor Enhancement*: Enabled expenses to be entered or edited in a different currency.
** *What it does:* Allows the user to add and edit fixed expenses in a different currency based on a preset `exchangerate` set when setting a Trip.
** Justification: This feature will enable users to add fixed expenses in different currencies, such as attraction tickets as they tend to be in a foreign currency.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Created an interactive Pie Chart along with list for fixed expense.
** *What it does:* Provides the user with a visual aid and breakdown of their current fixed expenses prior to the trip.
** Justification: Allows them to determine which category of expenses they need to cut down if they are already over budget, or which categories they can spend more or less on.
